A simple yet effective way of setting which pages to prefetch and prerender on your site.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a new menu location on your site. This location is not actually seen but consists of a list of url's which are linked in the HEAD section of your site. These urls are automatically prefetched and or rendered by compatible browsers. Thus speeding the user experience for visitors when they proceed on to those pages in your site.

1. Upload the entire `lh-prefetch-and-render` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Appearance->Menus and create your list of urls to prefetch and render
1. Then go to Appearance->Menus->Manage Locations and set that menu as your Prefetch List
